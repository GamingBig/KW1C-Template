This is a extension not made for everyone, it is my first extension and I made it to quickly insert a template for my ICT study.

## Features

Write kw1c-template (modifiable in settings) to insert a template.

## Extension Settings

* `kw1c-template.Name`: The value to put in the name field.
* `kw1c-template.triggerWord`: The thing you have to type in to insert the template.

**Enjoy!**
